# Pharmacy Management System (CLI)
## By Marion Okondo

My project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) based Pharmacy Management System. It allows users to register and log in, create, update, and delete products, and place and view orders.

## Features
- User Authentication:
     - Users can register with a username and password.
     - Users can log in with their credentials.
     - Users can add, update products and even place orders.
- Product Management:
     - Create new products with name, price, and stock quantity.
     - Update existing products by modifying the name, price, and stock quantity.
     - Delete products
- Order Management:
    - Place orders for available products.
    - Orders automatically decrease stock from the inventory.
    - Orders track user information, product details and quantity
- View Orders
     - Users can view all orders placed.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- SQLAlchemy: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for interacting woth the SQLite database.
